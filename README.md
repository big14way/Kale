# 🥬 KALE Pension Fund

**Revolutionizing Retirement Security in Africa with Blockchain Technology**

A decentralized pension fund built on Stellar blockchain, leveraging KALE token and Reflector Oracle to provide inflation-protected retirement savings for African workers.

## 🌍 Problem Statement

- **60% of Africans have NO retirement savings**
- Traditional pension systems fail due to currency volatility (20-40% annual devaluation)
- Limited financial infrastructure (only 43% have bank accounts)
- No access to diversified, inflation-hedged investment options

## 💡 Solution

KALE Pension Fund provides:
- **Multi-asset portfolios** (KALE, USDC, BTC) with automated rebalancing
- **Real-time price feeds** via Reflector Oracle integration
- **Risk-based allocation strategies** (Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive)
- **Cross-border accessibility** across all African countries
- **Mobile-first design** supporting both smartphones and USSD

- Multi-asset portfolio management
- Automated rebalancing based on Reflector price feeds
- Circuit breaker protection during market volatility
- Risk profile management (3 levels)

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
